HTML.AllowedElements
TYPE: lookup/null
VERSION: 1.3.0
DEFAULT: NULL
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
    If HTML Purifier's tag set is unsatisfactory for your needs, you 
    can overload it with your own list of tags to allow.  Note that this 
    method is subtractive: it does its job by taking away from HTML Purifier 
    usual feature set, so you cannot add a tag that HTML Purifier never 
    supported in the first place (like embed, form or head).  If you 
    change this, you probably also want to change %HTML.AllowedAttributes.

<p>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> If another directive conflicts with the 
    elements here, <em>that</em> directive will win and override.
