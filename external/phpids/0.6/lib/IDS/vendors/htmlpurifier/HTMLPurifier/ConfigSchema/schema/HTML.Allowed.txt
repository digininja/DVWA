HTML.Allowed
TYPE: itext/null
VERSION: 2.0.0
DEFAULT: NULL
--DESCRIPTION--

<p>
    This is a convenience directive that rolls the functionality of
    %HTML.AllowedElements and %HTML.AllowedAttributes into one directive.
    Specify elements and attributes that are allowed using:
    <code>element1[attr1|attr2],element2...</code>. You can also use
    newlines instead of commas to separate elements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Warning</strong>:
    All of the constraints on the component directives are still enforced.
    The syntax is a <em>subset</em> of TinyMCE's <code>valid_elements</code>
    whitelist: directly copy-pasting it here will probably result in
    broken whitelists. If %HTML.AllowedElements or %HTML.AllowedAttributes
    are set, this directive has no effect.
</p>
